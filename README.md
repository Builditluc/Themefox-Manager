# Themefox-Manager

### We have moved to https://github.com/themefox/Themefox-Manager. Please do everything on that repo

This is my first project in rust, so please excuse the terrible code quality and broken logic.

A super minimal and fast theme manager for Firefox written in 100% rust(Not yet finished)

Coming features: 
  
    -Very close support with the themefox website (yet to be released)

Already implemented features:
  
    -Downloading and installing (would work if the website would be up)
  
    -Mac, GNU/Linux support and Windows support (exe will come out with the next release)
    -A flag for resetting the firefox themes and make firefox look normal
  
 
Currently it runs on curl, so make sure you have that installed.

But if too many people say that sucks (hopefully not) i can also program another solution (which would mean larger executables, because a zero-dependencie solution is hard to impossible.
