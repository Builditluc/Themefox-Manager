# Themefox-Manager
A super minimal and fast theme manager for Firefox written in 100% rust(Not yet finished)

Coming features: 
  
    -Very close support with the themefox website (yet to be released)

Already implemented features:
  
    -Downloading and installing (currently only one firefox theme)
  
    -Mac, GNU/Linux support and Windows support (exe will come out with the next release)
  
 
Currently it runs on curl, so make sure you have that installed.

But if too many people say that sucks (hopefully not) i can also program another solution (which would mean larger executables, because a zero-dependencie solution is hard to impossible.
